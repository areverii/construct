# def assign_chunks(tasks: list, chunk_length_days: int) -> list:
#     """
#     Assign a chunk identifier to each task based on the overall schedule's baseline timespan.
#     This version uses each taskâ€™s midpoint (computed from bl_start and bl_finish)
#     to determine its chunk. The overall schedule boundaries are computed using the earliest
#     bl_start and the latest bl_finish of all tasks.
    
#     Parameters:
#         tasks (list): List of task dictionaries. Each task should have "bl_start" and, ideally, "bl_finish".
#         chunk_length_days (int): The length (in days) of each chunk.
        
#     Returns:
#         list: Sorted list of unique chunk identifiers (e.g. ["chunk_0", "chunk_1", ...]).
